# Development

Start the dev server:

:::code-tabs

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

:::

The server starts at `http://localhost:4321`. The browser reloads automatically whenever you save a markdown file.

Astro handles all file watching, hot reloading, and module bundling. If you need to configure the dev server port, proxy settings, or any other runtime behaviour, refer to the [Astro dev server docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev).
