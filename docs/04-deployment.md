# Deployment

JAAD is built on Astro and produces a fully static site, making deployment straightforward on any static hosting platform. For detailed guides on deploying to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, and more, refer to the [official Astro deployment documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/).
