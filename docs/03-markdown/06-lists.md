# Lists

## Base

Ordered lists number items sequentially:

```
1. First item in the sequence
2. Second item follows naturally
3. Third item continues the pattern
```

1. First item in the sequence
2. Second item follows naturally
3. Third item continues the pattern

Unordered lists use bullet points:

```
- First bullet point
- Second bullet point
- Third bullet point
```

- First bullet point
- Second bullet point
- Third bullet point

Nested lists combine both styles:

```
1. Top level ordered item
   - Nested unordered item
   - Another nested item
2. Second top level item
   - Nested item here
     1. Deeply nested ordered
     2. Another deep item
```

1. Top level ordered item
   - Nested unordered item
   - Another nested item
2. Second top level item
   - Nested item here
     1. Deeply nested ordered
     2. Another deep item

## Task Lists

Task lists (GFM) render checkboxes:

```
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [ ] Another pending item
```

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [ ] Another pending item
