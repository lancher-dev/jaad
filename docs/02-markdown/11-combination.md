# Combinations

All elements work together naturally. Here's a **bold statement** with an `inline code reference` followed by a [link to external docs](https://docs.astro.build). The text flows naturally and maintains readability.

Complex combinations like this preserve formatting: **_bold italic text_** containing `code snippets` and [embedded links](/) all within the same sentence.
