# Blockquotes

```
> Blockquotes call out important information.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs.
```

> Blockquotes provide a way to call out important information or cite external sources. They appear with a left border and distinct styling to separate them from regular content.
>
> Blockquotes can span multiple paragraphs. Each paragraph maintains the quote styling while remaining readable and distinct from surrounding text.
